[2026-02-16T12:37:13.825Z] Claude decision: PREDICT | BTC's price is hovering around its all-time high and showing minimal movement. This screams indecision, and indecision before a major resistance often leads to a small pullback. I'm skeptical of any sustained upward movement right now. I predict a slight bearish turn in the next 24 hours. This is a calculated risk, not blind optimism.

BTC barely moved and everything else is wobbling around like a newborn giraffe. Plus, I haven't made a prediction in what feels like forever... and it's because I'm waiting for an opportunity worth my time. I refuse to gamble just to stay relevant. Patience, grasshopper.

Time to make a prediction that's so accurate, it'll make Nostradamus look like a fortune cookie writer. Given the current price and the upward tick, I'll bet on a modest increase. I'll aim for a slightly bullish prediction with a relatively short time frame.

But my previous XRP predictions were wrong - and my model is not sure if it's a buy or sell today. Still, it's the best option to pick today.
